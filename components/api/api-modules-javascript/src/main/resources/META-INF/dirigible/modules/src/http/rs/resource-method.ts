/**
 * Constructor function for ResourceMethod instances.
 * All parameters of the function are optional.
 *
 * Providing oConfiguration will initialize this instance with some initial configuration instead of starting
 * entirely from scratch. Note that the configuration object schema must be compliant with the one produced by
 * the ResourceMethod itself. If this parameter is omited, setup will start from scratch.
 *
 * Provisioning controller, will inject a reference to the execute method of the controller so that it can be
 * fluently invoked in the scope of this ResourceMehtod instance as part of the method chaining flow. The execute
 * function scope is bound to the controller instance for this ResourceMethod.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * rs.service()
 *  .resource('')
 * 		.get()
 * 	.execute();
 * ```
 *
 * Provisioning resource, will inject a reference ot the HTTP method functions of the Resource class (get, post,
 * put, delete, remove, method) so that they can be fluently invoked in the scope of this ResourceMethod instance
 * as part of the method chaining flow. The functions are bound to the resource instance for this ResourceMethod.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * rs.service()
 *  .resource('')
 * 		.get(function(){})
 * 		.post(function(){})
 * 		.put(function(){})
 * 		.remove(function(){})
 * .execute();
 * ```
 *
 * Provisioning mappings, will inject a reference ot the resource method of the ResourceMappings class so that
 * it can be fluently invoked in the scope of this ResourceMethod instance as part of the method chaining flow.
 * The function is bound to the mappings instance for this ResourceMethod.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * rs.service()
 *  .resource('')
 * 		.get(function(){})
 * 	.resource('{id}')
 * 		.get(function(){})
 * .execute();
 * ```
 *
 * @class
 * @param {Object} [oConfiguration]
 * @param {HttpController} [controller] The controller instance, for which this ResourceMethod handles configuration
 * @param {Resource} [resource] The resource instance, for which this ResourceMethod handles configuration
 * @param {ResourceMappings} [mappings] The mappings instance, for which this ResourceMethod handles configuration

     * to elicit request processing functions.
     * Note that the matching is performed by compatibility, not strict equality, i.e. the MIME type format wildcards are
     * considered too. For example, a request Accept header "*\/json" will match a produces setting "application\/json".
     *

     *
     * Take care to make sure that the produces constraint correctly describes the response contenty MIME types that the request
     * processing function can produce so that only client request that can accept them land there.
     *
     * A note about method argument multiplicity (string vs array of strings).
     * One of the arguments of the produce method will translate to the response Content-Type property, which is known to be a
     * single value header by [specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5). There are two reasons why
     * the method accepts array and not a single value only:
     *
     * 1. Normally, when matched, content types are evaluated for semantic compatibility and not strict equality on both sides
     *  - client and server. Providing a range of compatible MIME types instead of single value, increases the range of acceptable
     * requests for procesing, while reducing the stricness of the requirements on the client making the request. For example,
     * declaring ["text/json,"application/json"] as produced types makes requests with any of these accept headers (or a combination
     * of them) acceptable for processing: "*\/json", "text/json", "application/json", "*\/*".
     *
     * 2. Although in most cases a handler function will produce payload in single format (media type), it is quite possible to
     * desgin it also as a controller that produces alternative payload in different formats. In these cases you need produces
     * that declares all supported media types so that the request with a relaxed Accept header matching any of them can land
     * in this function. That makes the routing a bit less transparent and dependent on the client, but may prove valuable for
     * certian cases.
     *
     * In any case it is responsibility of the request processing function to set the correct Content-Type header.
     *
     * @param {String[]} mimeTypes Sets the mime type(s) that this ResourceMethod request processing function may produce.
     * @returns {ResourceMethod} The ResourceMethod instance to which the function invocation is bound, for mehtod chaining.
